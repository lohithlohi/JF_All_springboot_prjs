# Java Contact Manager

Create a contact manager that allows you to add, search, delete and view contacts. 
The contact manager should be able to store the following information about a contact:

- Full Name
- Phone Number

The contact manager should also be able to search for a contact by either their full name or phone number.

Once complete the functionalities must be tested using JUnit.
